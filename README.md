# resample

A utility to resample the images of a PDF to generate a new PDF.

## Installation

- Install a java runtime environment, such as from [AdoptOpenJDK](https://adoptopenjdk.net/).
- Download a [standalone JAR release](https://github.com/kjinho/resample/releases) of ```resample```
  and save it in the location of your PDF files
- OPTIONAL: For a system wide installation,
  - save the [standalone JAR release](https://github.com/kjinho/resample/releases) in an appropriate
    directory (e.g., in UNIX-like systems, /usr/local/share/resample/),
  - save the [optional startup ruby script](https://github.com/kjinho/resample/blob/master/bin/resample)
    someplace in your $PATH (e.g., in UNIX-like systems, /usr/local/bin/),
  - modify the ruby script to reflect the correct locations of the java runtime and the
    standalone JAR, and
  - set the proper permissions for the ruby script, such as with the following command:
    ```$ chmod 711 /usr/local/bin/resample```

## Usage

Calling the jar directly using a Java runtime:

    $ java -jar resample-0.1.0-standalone.jar --input [INPUT_FILE] --output [OUTPUT_FILE] [options]
    
Calling the jar indirectly using an 
[optional startup ruby script](https://github.com/kjinho/resample/blob/master/bin/resample)
